This project demonstrates the concepts of **encapsulation** and **inheritance** in Dart.  
It includes a base class (`School`) with private attributes, getters and setters with validation,  
and methods to manipulate data. Derived classes extend the base class, adding unique properties,  
methods, and overriding parent behavior to showcase inheritance.
